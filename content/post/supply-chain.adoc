The best way to read a book is to finish all the exercises.
But, focus on analytical exercises only, in order to save time.

== 1. Existence of latexmath:[Q^{\star}_s] under Wholesale Price Contract

Prove that, under the wholesale price contract, latexmath:[\pi_{s}(Q, w)] is:

* strictly decreasing in latexmath:[Q], if latexmath:[w<c_{s}-p_{s}]
* first increasing and then decreasing in latexmath:[Q],
  if latexmath:[c_{s}-p_{s}<w<c_{s}]
* strictly increasing in latexmath:[Q], if latexmath:[w>c_{s}]

The expression for latexmath:[\pi_{s}(Q, w)]
and its partial difference with respect to latexmath:[Q] are:

latexmath:[\begin{aligned}
\pi_{s}(Q, w) &= p_{s} S(Q) + \left(w-c_{s}\right) Q-p_{s} \mu \\
\frac{\partial \pi_{s}}{\partial Q} &= p_s (1 - F(Q)) + w - c_s \\
&= w - \left[c_s - p_s (1 - F(Q)) \right\]
\end{aligned}]

Because the value of latexmath:[1 - F(Q)] is between 0 and 1.

== 2. Wholesale Price Contract for Breach of Contract

A new novel, the legal thriller _Breach of Contract_,
will begin to be sold at your local bookstore next month.
The bookstore must decide how many copies of the book to order,
and it cannot reorder again after the initial order.
The book will be sold for a certain duration (say, 6 months),
after which all copies will be removed from the shelves
and sold to a paper-recycling company as scrap.

_Breach of Contract_ will be sold to consumers for $18.99 (latexmath:[r]) per copy.
The publisher charges the bookstore a wholesale price of $11 (latexmath:[w]) per copy.
For each copy purchased by the bookstore,
the publisher incurs raw-material costs of $3.75,
and the bookstore incurs shipping and handling costs of $1.20.
(This is not paid to the publisher.)
The total demand for the book during the selling season is expected to be normally distributed
with a mean of 1200 and a standard deviation of 340.
Unmet demands are lost,
incurring loss-of-goodwill costs estimated at $9.00 for the bookstore and $4.00 for the publisher.
Unsold books are sold to the recycling company for $0.65 each.

* What is the bookstore's optimal order quantity?
* What is the order quantity that maximizes the total expected profit for the supply chain,
  and what is the optimal total expected profit?
* What is each companyâ€™s expected profit,
  and what is the total expected profit for the supply chain?
  What is the efficiency of the contract?
* Suppose the publisher can choose any wholesale price it wishes.
  What wholesale price will it choose?
  What order quantity will the bookstore choose as a result?
  What will be the resulting profits?
  What will be the efficiency of the contract?
