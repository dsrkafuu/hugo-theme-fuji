Here are the notes for three algorithms of spanning arborescences of some
directed graph.

<!--more-->

The topology and edge attributes are stored in three incidence functions
(dictionaries in Python).

There are efficient ranking algorithms for other settings.

## Notes for Authors' Writings

- A "loop" refers a self-looped edge, whose two terminals are the same node.
