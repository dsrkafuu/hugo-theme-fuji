Programmable thermostats are recommanded by the US energy department, and
temperature requirements for future time slots can be input in a "smart"
thermostat, like Google Nest.

## Introduction

Programmable thermostats should be used as a tool for household users to
interact with the dynamic systems. This tool must be able to receive and
process users' requests in real time. Usually, a so called smart thermostat
analyses all the user input in a pre-defined frequency and adapt its control
signals.

The task of the developer is twofold:

- Design one interaction interface.
- Design a software agent (another decision process) to receive and provide
  information, in order to facilitate the decision process of the user.
- Controller for the dynamic systems to support the whole process

## Thermostat Operation

> You can save as much as 10% a year on heating and cooling by simply turning
> your thermostat back 7째-10째F (7째-10째C) for 8 hours a day from its normal
> setting.

> Although thermostats can be adjusted manually, programmable thermostats will
> avoid any discomfort by returning temperatures to normal before you wake or
> return home.

## User's Reservation

- provide information to the user
- ask information from the user
- utilise such information

The user can do more with the reservation feature, and shoulder the blame if it
doesn't work.

But there is always an option for continuing the old habit that the user can
choose.

## Ration / Control End Users Constraint

There are more control variables from the system operator side. In district
heating networks, as long as the return temperature reaches the level, on which
the bacteria cannot survive, the system operator is free to choose. The flow
can be adjusted. This is not the case for power grids.
