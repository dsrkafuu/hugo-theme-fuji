> The relationship between letters and the sounds they represent is more
> straightforward in German than in English and, in general, each sound of
> German corresponds to a single letter or group of letters. However, there are
> a few exceptions to this. [durrell2013hammer](#references)

> We can distinguish in German between simple words (or ‘root words’) like
> Kind, dort and schön, which cannot be broken down, and complex words like
> kindisch, dortig and Schönheit, which are made up of more than one component
> and are derived from simple words in some way.
