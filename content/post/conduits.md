The infrastructure like transmission grids, distribution grids, district
heating, gas transportation, and [thermodynamic
cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_cycle) can be modelled in a
similar way, at least when they are in steady state. A special type of
bipartite consisting two types of buses is brought up here.

## Steady Flow Process

A steady flow process (SFP) is "a process during which a fluid flows through a
control volume steadily". [cengel2019thermodynamics](#references)

"The term steady implies no change with time. The opposite of steady is
unsteady, or transient." [cengel2019thermodynamics](#references)
