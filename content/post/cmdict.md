## Basic Info

- Different Python enumerations are designed.

## Phonetics

### International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

> The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is an alphabetic system of phonetic
> notation based primarily on the Latin script. It was devised by the
> International Phonetic Association in the late 19th century as a standardized
> representation of speech sounds in written form. [wikipedia2021international]

### Correspondence to Spelling

## Morphology

> In linguistics, morphology is the study of words, how they are formed, and
> their relationship to other words in the same language. It analyzes the
> structure of words and parts of words such as stems, root words, prefixes,
> and suffixes. Morphology also looks at parts of speech, intonation and
> stress, and the ways context can change a word's pronunciation and meaning.
> [wikipedia2021morphology]

More important for syntax language like German.

The ability to find its original form is very important.

### Inflection

> In linguistic morphology, inflection (or inflexion) is a process of word
> formation, in which a word is modified to express different grammatical
> categories such as tense, case, voice, aspect, person, number, gender, mood,
> animacy, and definiteness. The inflection of verbs is called conjugation, and
> one can refer to the inflection of nouns, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns,
> determiners, participles, prepositions and postpositions, numerals, articles
> etc., as declension. [wikipedia2021inflection]

It can also provide hints on how a complex or inflected word is composed of.

- Conjugation
- Declension

### Derivation
