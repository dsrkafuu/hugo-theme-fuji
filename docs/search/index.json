There are more benefits.\nThe core ingredient, snapshot, is discussed in detail first, and how multiple snapshots for one graph are store is introduced in two sections, increment and meta-graph. The modification of the graph can be based on transactions, which is discussed in section transaction. A better place to store such data values is a database, and how a relational database design might look like is discussed. Lastly, a new concept, secondary snapshot, is brought up to generalise the idea for attributes of edges and nodes.\nI am assuming we are on the same page in terms of:\n Basic concepts in graph theory, like simple graph, bipartite, tree. [bondy2008graph] Basic knowledge about relational databases. [postgresql2021documentation] Basic knowledge about data abstraction. [section 1.2 in sedgewick2014algorithms] Basic knowledge about version control. [section 1.1 in chacon2014pro]  For those behind, the links mentioned above are good starting points. The last page should be:\n How to store changes of a simple graph in an incremental manner. How the snapshot concept contributes to storage, version control, query, etc of graphs.  Note that all the graphs discussed here are simple graphs without any node or edge attribute. Furthermore, the node is not the primary concern.\nSnapshot At Utiligize, we stored the topology of power grids in a relational database. I found some queries were very popular:\n Query the whole graph. Query the whole graph and calculate a subgraph. Query the whole graph and modify it. Modify the graph.  Most representations assume that there is no further update. For example, in pandapower, values can only be found via indices and updated accordingly. A data structure is discussed here, so the modification is a first class passenger as well. Besides, to represent the temporal evolution of some graph as a series of snapshots [section 4.1.2 in masuda2021guide] is one of the many applications of the snapshot concept. There are at least two other applications:\n A snapshot can store a subgraph from some query. A set of snapshots can represents some neighbours of the graph in terms of topology.  That is, the snapshot concept can not only be used in version control, but also served as the core in storing, modification, and query. The program should revolve around a set of associated snapshots.\nIncrement To store snapshots as individual graphs requires lots of memory space. For example, to treat snapshots as different layers and connect related layers with bipartites. [section 5.2 in bianconi2018multilayer]. Instead, given a graph and its differences between another unknown graph, the unknown can be computed accordingly, so the space required can be largely reduced, especially when such two graphs are similar. Those differences can be wrapped in one concept, increment. A way to store and utilise increments for snapshots of graphs is discussed here.\nEvent As discussed before, the graph can always be seen as a set of two-entry tuples (edge-list), when no isolated node is present. Then, any modification to a graph can be seen as some state change(s) of some edge(s), and it can also be represented by a two-entry tuple, indicating which edge is modified. In particular, the only two fundamental modification is to add an edge or to delete an edge. Such modification can be seen as an event. Thus, a graph, a snapshot or an increment can be seen as a set of events.\nThe concept of event can be interpreted as follows. It is assumed that there are two possible states, on and off, for any edge. The default state is off. An event associated with snapshot s in terms of edge (u, v) can be represented by a three-entry tuple, (u, v, s). Note that the definition here is different from that in masuda2021guide.\nLink Which snapshot the increment is based on must be specified, though the relationship can be modified later. This relationship will be called link here. For example, if there are three graphs represented by a, b and c, a can be derived from its increment linked to b or its increment linked to c. The derivation must be based on the linked graph, of course, as discussed before.\nMultiple links are allowed, because the size of some increment might be reduced further. To follow the previous example, a can be linked to b and c, and the size of the corresponding increment might be reduced further.\nSymmetric Difference The only mathematical operation required for calculating increments and recovering snapshots is symmetric difference. From wikipedia2021symmetric:\n In mathematics, the symmetric difference of two sets, also known as the disjunctive union, is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection.\n For example:\n{a, b} △ {b, c} = {a, c} {a, b} △ {b, c} △ {c, d} = {a, d}  The second example indicates that the operation can be generalised to successive symmetric differences of a series of sets. The sequence of such sets does not matter. This generalised version can be applied when such sets are found via a concept brought up in the section.\nMeta-Graph Several snapshots and corresponding links compose a directed graph when snapshots and links are considered as nodes and edges respectively. That graph will be called meta-graph. The directions of links do not matter, as long as they are consistent. For example, to direct out of the snapshot. Then, according to the definition above, meta-graph is a directed acyclic graph (a directed graph without directed cycle).\nThe definition of directed cycle follows that in sedgewick2020algorithms:\n A directed path in a digraph is a sequence of vertices in which there is a (directed) edge pointing from each vertex in the sequence to its successor in the sequence, with no repeated edges. A directed cycle is a directed path (with at least one edge) whose first and last vertices are the same.\n Such concept is similar to that in version control [wikipedia2021version] when commits and merges are considered as nodes.\nRecover Snapshot The increments of all the parents of a given snapshot compose those sets for symmetric difference.\nPower Flow Timeline A power flow timeline is an undirected path of the meta-graph and a starting snapshot, which must be one of the two terminals of the path. The power flow calculation starts with the starting snapshot and use the voltage result of the precedent snapshot as the initial guess, which can speed up the calculation to a large extent.\nDedicated statements can be designed to build a timeline in a higher abstraction level.\nAutomated Debug in PF The algorithms for power flow are very sensitive to errors in the grid model. The software can provide some procedure modifying the timeline automatically, in order to debug such errors.\nTransaction Being immutable is a main feature of snapshots. A mechanism should be designed to allow modifications before the snapshot becomes immutable. The idea of transaction comes from relational database. The beginning of a transaction is to provide a graph object that the user can work on.\nThough this mechanism based on transactions is similar to that in most relational databases, the terminologies do not correspond.\nPending Snapshot All the events in the increment for the pending snapshot can be previewed. Note that any modification is made to a snapshot, but the snapshot is stored in the form of increment.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s possible to have multiple pending snapshots. Then any user or several users can work on multiple pending snapshots at the same time. When it comes to storage, pending snapshots are written in the database as well, but still mutable.\nMultiple (committed) snapshots can be specified when a pending snapshot is initiated. However, the initiated snapshot is calculated via successive symmetric differences of associated increments.\nWhile other pending snapshots are invisible, committed snapshots resulted from other transactions are visible immediately in the current transaction. This setting is adopted in most relational database systems like PostgreSQL [postgresql2021transactions] (Note that terminologies are different, while the idea is shared, as discussed before).\nCommit The link can only be associated with committed snapshots. The link(s) can be modified later, in order to, for example, reduce the size of the increment. Whenever a snapshot is to be deleted, no other snapshot should be based on it.\nReplacement There are many algorithms designed for graphs. For example, a pending snapshot can be converted to an networkx object and modified via algorithms in networkx. That is, it is more convenient not to write snapshot using traditional SQL queries. After some modifications, the pending snapshot can be replaced entirely by the networks object.\nThe prototypical workflow of an transaction can be summarised as follows:\n Obtain an networkx object representing a pending snapshot by specifying linked snapshots. Modify the pending snapshot using functions in networkx. Replace the pending snapshot in the database with the modified one. Commit the snapshot.  Also, because multiple pending snapshots are allowed. The steps 1-3 can be done simultaneously for different pending snapshots, and one user can work on different pending snapshots simultaneously. Furthermore, as discussed in subsection link, links can be modified later as long as they point to committed snapshots.\nSecondary Snapshot Second snapshots is a concept to store evolutions of attributes of edges and nodes, and its topology remains unchanged. It is recommended that attributes associated with some edge are stored in one object. For node attributes, they can be stored in objects attached to the node. The advantages have been discussed in another post, relational database not for power girds. Detailed discussion about objects when modelling power grids can be found in post, power grid as multilayer network.\nThe concept of power flow timelines can be generalised for secondary snapshots.\nReferences  Bianconi, G.

There are three major flaws in terms of relational model for power grids, which are discussed in detail. The last two sections mention document-based databases and snapshots briefly.\nI am assuming we are on the same page in terms of:\n Some Python packages, like pandapower, PyPSA, networkx, and matplotlib. Relational database, like PostgreSQL. Object-oriented programming. For example, classes in Python, docs.python.org. Graph theory. [bondy2008graph] Concepts like buses, elements, snapshots, etc discussed in the Power Grid as Multilayer Network post. Basics of graph databases, like Neo4j, and document-based databases, like MongoDB.  For those behind, the links mentioned above are good starting points. The last page should be:\n Why I dislike incumbent open-sourced tools for power system analysis. Why relational model should not be used to model power grids.  Many-to-Many Relation The only normalised column in the schema of pandapower is for buses. Usually, all the tables, except that for buses used the key for buses as the only foreign key. In particular, tables for delivery elements like cables and transformers have two columns for buses, because they have two and only two terminals. Actually, such relation is many-to-many, but there is no intermediary table to model it. As discussed above, the purpose is to reduce the number of tables. However, it becomes very hard to query associated elements given a bus.\nIn-Memory Operations Lots of graph-related operations are required. For example, the return of the corresponding subgraph for a particular voltage level is very important. It can be done using in pandapower, but an networkx object must be built first. Such idea is actually required before building a pandapower object, which is discussed in the following subsection. In contrast, it\u0026rsquo;s easier (and maybe more efficient) to do that with a graph database like Neo4j.\nAlso, to store some query results is a good idea, so that to execute the query multiple times is avoided. However, there are some pitfalls, if, for example, they are dumped in CSV files:\n It takes too much space. Hard to keep track of such files, especially when multiple files result from one query. New queries to read such files are required. Hard to update the result if the original grid is modified.  Another motivation is that to read the whole grid and plot (even part of) it in a map using packages like matplotlib requires too much computing resource. Furthermore, as far as I know, there is no package in Python that can handle the interactive view of a large grid in a map. To inspect the grid interactively helps a lot in debugging and preparing queries.\nDifferent Schemas The biggest challenge we face at Utiligize was that the schema used in our clients' database was different from that in pandapower and other tools. In particular, transformers should be associated with two buses, but were represented as a point from the geographical perspective. We stored tables from our clients in one database. My colleagues maintained two sets of tables for two schemas manually. There is no built-in tools in incumbent packages, so they had to write their own queries. From time to time, some clients modified their data by sending new excel files. Then, my colleagues updated the tables involved. Though it seems that the transformation (by modifying strings) to the schema of pandapower is not hard, I found a major bug around October, 2020. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to take all kinds of situations into consideration in string modification.\nSince then, I had never been sure about that transformation, so I wrote edxu96/mgrid (v0.2.0), which builds a networkx direct graph and then do an operation call vertex splitting. There is only one situation (to categorise associated edges into two layers), so some unit tests are enough. Furthermore, a concept called multilayer network can be used to handle such issues in general. [bianconi2018multilayer] It\u0026rsquo;s discussed in another post, Power Grid as Multilayer Network, in detail. Though the process was slowed down a bit, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about updating tables in the second schema.\nObject-Relational Mismatch Another big problem is inherent in pandapower, PyPSA, and matpower, etc. All of them are initially designed for power flow calculation (PF) and optimal power flow optimisation (OPF) of transmission grids. As mentioned before, how parameters are stored is similar to a relational database. However, there are two reasons why this way is problematic.\nFirstly, the sets of parameters used in PF, in OPF and for different devices are quite different. Such issue is resolved in two ways for the time being, as far as I know. Firstly, there are tables corresponding to different types of electrical devices. Most of the tables are not involved because, in reality, nodal injections are usually given in PF, so the most important tables are for buses, cables, transformers, loads, and generators. Then, the second way is to generalise such tables, because it is more confusing to have a table for loads in PF, one for loads in unbalanced PF, one for loads in OPF, etc. However, such generalisation results in lots of NaN values, because only a small portion of columns are involved in PF.\nFurthermore, pre-defined functions (imagine SQL queries) to insert and modify records are very confusing because of too many optional arguments. Even worse, there is only one method add in Network class in PyPSA. The user has to memorise combinations of keyword arguments themselves.\nThe second reason is resulted from the fact that models for transmission grids are different from those for distribution grids (for example, 400 V). With further penetration of electric vehicles and solar panels, constraints on voltages and loadings of low-voltage distribution grids are more likely to be violated. The features for distribution grids have been gradually introduced. However, the set of parameters required for the same type of electric devices can be quite different from that in transmission grids. For example, to support unbalanced PF in pandapower, two tables, res_line and res_line_3ph, are required for storing results. When PF and unbalanced PF are required for two parts in the same grid, two pandapower objects are required. There is no tool capable of handling balanced and unbalanced grids at the same time.\nI believe, this shortcoming is largely resulted from the object-relational mismatch in relational database and object-oriented programming (OOP), which is discussed in the second chapter of [kleppmann2017designing]. Additionally, it is impossible to store a network model in one (CSV) file. This shortcoming seems to be the main motivation behind document model for power system models, and it is discussed in the following section.\nDocument-Based Database Actually, OOP can help a lot when modelling power grids, and document model has been proposed. For example, see PowerModels.jl and PowerSystems.jl. It is very easy to dump a model in one JSON file. However, one the hardest part, to transform data in another database schema, is never mentioned, and there is no function to insert element.\nFurthermore, the many-to-many relationship and graph-related operations are still not fully supported. The whole grid has to be read in memory first. These are among the inherent disadvantages of document-based databases.\nSnapshot Though it is easy to store time series in relational model, PF for multiple snapshots is very problematic in tools discussed above. For example, in pandapower, which time series to be stored must be specified and results can only be stored in CSV files.\nThe concept of snapshot is vital in PF and OPF. To use voltage results from the consecutive snapshot can largely reduce the number of iterations. For example, voltage magnitude results can be passed as init_vm_pu argument in pandapower. However, at least in pandapower, values are updated in different snapshot, based on specified data and \u0026ldquo;controller\u0026rdquo;, which I think is really confusing and hard to be used.\nConclusion There are issues in different levels when storing power grid models in relational databases. The most obvious one is that the many-to-many relationship between buses and electric devices is usually missing. Then lots of operations, like to select part of the grid, must be done by reading the grid in memory first and relying on other graph theoretic packages, which is very inefficient and fallible. The biggest issue is probably to transform the raw data in a different schema in the first place. Moreover, raw datasets are usually updated from time to time.\nThe inherent issue is the mismatch between object-oriented programming and relational databases. A compromise used to be worked out, but there are more and more classes for electric devices involved. This issue must be dealt with by introducing document models. However, document databases are still unable to cope with the first three issues for the moment.\nReferences  Bianconi, G. (2018). Multilayer networks: structure and function.

Here are some points that worth mentioning.\nSubject, Tool and Experiment The most important thing I realised is that there is a huge difference between tools and subjects. Most of the courses I took during bachelor should be classified as subjects. For example, \u0026ldquo;power electronics in renewable energy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;distributed energy system and theory\u0026rdquo;. Only some math courses in the freshman year provide means to handle calculation in subject courses. Though I was exposed to all kinds of \u0026ldquo;technologies\u0026rdquo;, only one subject will be the subject during work or PhD.\nI started thinking about this distinction when choosing the topic of my Bachelor thesis. The idea was to focus on a tool that can utilise my \u0026ldquo;knowledge\u0026rdquo; about different energy \u0026ldquo;technologies\u0026rdquo;. I did find a tool, which I think should be called physical modelling. The subjects are thee kinds of thermal engines and heat transfers. The thesis got me an award from the university, and it is hosted in edxu96/StaticDESim.\nAt that time, the MSc program focusing on energy system analysis at DTU caught my eyes. I had read a book for energy system analysis [introduction2021blok] that time and loved the idea. However, during the first year at DTU, I realised those subjects are too broad. For example, International Energy Agency (IEA) is the top institution in this field, and publishes lots of data and analysis about country-level energy systems. There is a very important concept called \u0026ldquo;scenario\u0026rdquo; that I never encountered before. For example, there is a tool called TIMES, in which DTU participated. It seems to me that most of the energy system analysis models are based on parameters from such \u0026ldquo;scenarios\u0026rdquo;, because the spatial and temporal scope is so broad that statistical models are not applicable. Such models provide a convenient way for the public, politicians and \u0026ldquo;researchers\u0026rdquo; to communicate, and contribute a lot, for example, to Danish climate policies. There are multiple courses on such modelling, but statistics never play an important role. The building of \u0026ldquo;scenarios\u0026rdquo; is too subjective. Besides, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can find a job or build something new in such field, largely because I am an outsider. Gradually, I lost interest. (There are other topics in energy system analysis like life cycle analysis [burkhardt2011life] that I don\u0026rsquo;t want to talk about.)\nLuckily, another focus of that major is optimisation. I took many courses, though never go beyond the limit of MILP. In my mind, they focused too much on algorithms, which are important, indeed, but boring. How to apply MILP to practical problems [williams2013model] was never mentioned. Besides, the area, decision making under uncertainty [conejo2010decision], interests me and it requires statistics. So I had to learn statistics from scratch. I did take course in probability in Taiwan, but it was mainly about combinatorial analysis (see, for example, chapter 1 of first2014ross) and a bit about Bayes' theorem. Now, MILP and basic statistical models have been in my toolbox.\nIn summer 2019, I took my favourite course, stochastic simulation, (for which I worked as TA in summer 2020). I didn\u0026rsquo;t really understand the course until the teacher summarised it, in the last lecture, as \u0026ldquo;computer experiments with mathematical models\u0026rdquo; [santner2018design]. For example, discrete event simulation. [law2015simulation] I begun to understand the importance of scientific experiments. Also, to make friends with the teacher, I audited the stochastic processes course [pinsky2010introduction] in autumn 2019, which is the hardest course I ever take. The benefit is that I has become familiar with other topics in operations research. Overall, every aspects for mathematical and physical simulation become no stranger to me.\nIn that autumn, I also became addicted to the graph theory course, and audited every lecture. Furthermore, it played a dominant role in my master thesis and my part-time job at Utiligize company. Such experiences contribute to edxu96/mgrid, and this subject, utility networks, has become my focus since.\nCollaboration The most important lesson I learnt in Denmark is collaboration. Every single course more or less emphasises collaboration, even when individual assignments are the only requirement. There were some collaborative courses during my bachelor, but the first thing we did was to spit the task equally and finished it on our own. Surprisingly, in Denmark, the usual way in terms of collaboration is to do exercises/assignments together (real-time and face-to-face), aka group work (see a post in DTU International Student Blog), which I never see in China.\nThere are advantages and disadvantages. I really hate this group work stuff and tried to avoid it during the first two years, because it is not how software engineers work together and my oral English was too poor at that time. But this way of study is deeply integrated, since it usually takes half of the course time. Teachers and TAs will be present, answering questions. I regret not taking the opportunity now, because to receive help from teachers and TAs can largely improve the final grade. It\u0026rsquo;s not sufficient to know everything from lectures. Instead, after the lecture, I went back to my dorm, where I read books and wrote code alone.\nAnother example, I used to love writing LaTeX using overleaf.com, and in one course, my teammates decided to rely on its real-time collaboration feature. I never agreed with the idea and spent my time writing Julia code, in order to obtain results our final assignment of that course. The writing was a disaster, because this issue, What if a collaborator makes changes I don\u0026rsquo;t want to keep?, was never resolved. The worst scenario was that we could not compile the file until main contents were pasted in another template. Then it occurred to me that version control can be apply to writing as well, so I stopped using overleaf.com afterwards.\nA more suitable approach I can think of, which is also adopted by some teams, is to have multiple short meetings followed by individual work. The biggest two problems of group work are irregular interruptions from teammates and the mix of formal and casual conversation. So at the time of group work, the classroom is very noisy. Scheduled short meetings can be focused on formal conversation and afford students multiple long periods of uninterrupted time.\nIn terms of code, I was never able to collaborate with others, because I never saw anyone capable of basic code refactoring. In summer 2020, I managed to follow the practice of continuous integration and master GitHub issues. It always surprises me how much effort is required to reach this milestone, and how much it helps after. I stuck to this practice when coding and writing for my master thesis.\nSchedule To schedule day-to-day life and work is not trivial. I have never seen a teacher or a working colleague who doesn\u0026rsquo;t schedule their daily activities. I started to reply heavily on timetables in the second semester, when the courses I took were very hard. My plan was to pass all the courses, so I formulated \u0026amp; adjusted my timetable accordingly everyday. Moreover, during the pandemic, online meetings can be fully integrated in the timetable software.\nIn my experience, a good starting point is to separate any day into three 4-hour periods: morning, afternoon and night. A very, if not most, important thing is to leave enough time for sleep and meals, because the daily schedule must be sustainable. As discussed above, GitHub issues can facilitate collaboration. It can also log to-do list and the study progress. What\u0026rsquo;s next can be easily found and prioritised.\nSelf-Study Self-study skills are always worth mentioning. To read is the most important one, and it is the cornerstone of all the other skills. For example, I always believe only a small portion of information is delivered in lectures or slides, so I always read all the materials before lectures. Also, one can never write until read some materials in the same domain. The last example has been discussed before in work as TA. The only way to understand some algorithm is to read its pseudo-code or description.\nTo admit one\u0026rsquo;s reading limit is not easy. There are many milestones in terms of levels in my mind. To read and understand textbooks is just the first step. It\u0026rsquo;s harder to read journal papers because of the inadequate editing and different writing styles. The materials in the next level are news and magazines, and I admit consulting dictionaries a lot. There are many words with which I am not familiar. The highest level, I think, is to read novels. The only novel in English I have ever dared to read is \u0026ldquo;The Little Prince\u0026rdquo;.\nAgain, one can formulate reading lists using GitHub issues. It also serves as an outline in case some contents are needed in the future.\nBefore the pandemic, I always print books and gather printed papers to books and it helps a lot. It takes a while to adjust text sizes sometimes, but there are many advantages. To write directly on pages really enhance the reader\u0026rsquo;s concentration. Also, to transcribe formulas strengthen the reader\u0026rsquo;s visualisation memory. Gradually, I got used to reading long texts and became able to read papers on screen, when the pandemic hit.\nAnother important skill is test (validation), which has been discussed in work as TA as well. The last one I want to mention is to pose questions. For example, I posted a question about my application of KKT condition and received lots of valuable feedbacks. To write a well-defined question requires effort, but reward with high-quality answers and an improvement in writing.\nReference  Blok, K., \u0026amp; Nieuwlaar, E. (2021).

A graph in each layer represents all the cables at the same voltage level. A directed bipartite for a pair of adjacent layers consists of transformers connecting two voltage levels.\nmgrid provides an interface for modelling power grids and conduct power system analysis using pandapower and PyPSA. Though the way to build models (define buses, and connect them with transformers \u0026amp; cables, \u0026hellip;) is similar, syntax is very different.\nI have wrapped up my 5 months work at Utiligize, and build a package, mgrid, for power system analysis.\nTopology, Element, Snapshot Here, information for power system analysis is separated into three parts. The most basic part about a power grid is topology, how buses are connected. A class based on directed graph model in networkx package is used to store such information. This way, many existing methods and functions in networkx can be utilised directly. Bus is an imaginary concept to enforce Kirchhoff\u0026rsquo;s law. There is no power loss within any bus. It is not necessary to distinguish buses as PQ, PV, or slack.\nThe OpenDSS software (EPRI2021penDSS) divides electrical devices in power grids into two categories. The most basic one, called delivery element, has two terminals and moves electricity from one bus to another. Cables and transformers fit into this category. Any edge in topology corresponds to one and only one delivery element, and vice versa. The second category is conversion element, which converts electricity from or to another energy form. Such devices have only one terminal and must be connected to a bus. Such categorisation method is applied here.\nIn pandapower or PyPSA, different models for cables, for example, are built using one function (method). There are many optional arguments in such functions, which can be confusing. In mgrid, any element model can be modelled by a Python class. For example, one-line equivalent model for poly-phase cables is mgrid.power_flow.delivery.Cable, while detailed version for 3-phase cables is mgrid.power_flow.delivery.Cable3Phase. The number of optional arguments is largely reduced. Though classes are different, for delivery or conversion elements, methods to add them to a grid are the same. For example, Cable.update_pandapower, Cable3Phase.update_pandapower, and TransformerStd.update_pandapower both take a pandapower network and two terminals as arguments. Moreover, how to add element is entirely specified in update_pandapower. This feature makes it easier for users to define their own class. The function to build a pandapower network in mgrid will always use update_pandapower to add the element.\nThe last part takes time-variance into account. One snapshot consists of one set of nodal injections and one set of voltages. It is assumed that the grid remains steady state during the period which the snapshot specifies. At least in power flow calculation, adjacent snapshots do not have an impact. However, in terms of multiple snapshots, it is beneficial to consider snapshots together because voltage results from the previous snapshot can be used as the initial guess, which reduces the number of iterations. Data-frames with multi-level indices are used to store such information in mgrid. That way, any snapshot or series of results for any bus can be easily cross-sectioned using pandas.DataFrame.xs.\nMultilayer Network There are two kinds of edges in a multilayer network. Any intra-edge can only exist in a single layer and correspond to cables. Inter-edges connect layers and correspond to transformers in terms of power grids. Such two kinds of edges and the correspondence between voltage levels and layers are the two most useful features.\nA multilayer network can be represented in three ways. The first one, with multiple graphs for different layers and directed bipartites for inter-edges, is mentioned in the introduction. Then, as introduced in bianconi2018multilayer, supra graph integrates intra-edges in different layers and inter-edges in one graph. This format is used when modelling power grids using dedicated power system analysis software. The last one is called planar graph here, and it contracts inter-edges in the supra graph. That way, inter-edges, representing transformers, become inter-nodes. Datasets for power grids are usually structured in this manner because transformers look like points geographically.\nUsually, nodes are replicated in different layers. bianconi2018multilayer However, here, all the intra-nodes are unique, and inter-node pairs are distinguished by suffixes, which makes the supra graph format easier to be derived. This assumption reflects the reality that buses tend to locate in different geographical points. The disadvantage is that some algorithms designed for multilayer networks might be inapplicable.\nDistributed External Grids There are multiple 150-60 kV transformers in some subcomponents, connecting to external grids. Though their RPIs can be known from DC OPF, one or a set of them must be chosen as slack bus(es) in AC power flow.\nAC power flow for with distributed slack has been implemented in PyPSA only. To use pandapower, one and only one 150-60 kV transformer should be chosen as the slack bus. Participation factors resulted from automatic generation control (AGC) can be used as weights for a set of buses with generators.\nWhat if Divergence For power flow calculation, it is hard to know the reason when the iteration diverges. To debug, we can divide the grid into smaller parts and calculate power flow individually. After detecting the part(s) which result(s) in the divergence, it can be excluded in the original grid. Conversion elements can be attached to the bus, which represents the excluded part. That way, the calculation for the grid will converge, and the error is merely the loss along cables and transformers in the excluded part.\nVoltage Drop The direct impedance method can be easily used for radial distribution feeders (RDF) to calculate voltage drops. Then, with the voltage at root known after power flow for higher voltage levels, voltages can be calculated accordingly.\nThe nonlinear relationship between complex voltages \\(\\overline{\\boldsymbol{V}} \\) and PRIs \\(\\overline{\\boldsymbol{I}} \\) can be expressed using bus impedance matrix: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\overline{\\boldsymbol{V}} = \\overline{\\boldsymbol{Z}} \\overline{\\boldsymbol{I}} \u0026#43; \\overline{\\boldsymbol{V}}_\\text{zero} \\end{aligned} $$ where vector \\( \\overline{\\boldsymbol{V}}_\\text{zero}\\) is for zero-load snapshot.\nIt might be problematic to apply the direct impedance method for high-voltage lines, because they should be modelled using one-line equivalent Pi models. The current loss must be taken into account.\nReference  [bianconi2018multilayer] Bianconi, G. (2018). Multilayer networks: structure and function. Oxford university press.

The course consists of 6 lecture days (3 hours lecture and 4 hours exercise per day) and a group project. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, everything has to be done online, which made it harder for everyone.\nGroup Forming There are three TAs in total, and we relied on a online registration platform to collect information on students' questions and requests for help. The platform is made out of Google Forms and Google Sheets. Any student can fill a form, and it will appear immediately in a online sheet, which can be seen by TAs and the teacher. The platform helped a lot indeed, but we ignored the most important problem, forming groups.\nIn Denmark, most of the courses require students to form groups and write reports together. I always think the real reason is to reduce the number of reports that teachers must evaluate. There are 174 students registered this course, and a project report usually takes 40 minutes for one TA to read and write feedback. So to form groups is mandatory. Nevertheless, it is really challenging for students, international students especially, to find a group when the course is happening online. The teacher spent the whole first day helping students who don\u0026rsquo;t know others find a teammate. There should be some online platform to let students exhibiting their abilities and preferences and match them instead of doing manually. In my experience, to have reliable teammates is critical in obtaining a a high grad and even finish the course. The teacher told us that he would like students from the same major to form a group, because he believe that everyone relies on alumni in the same sector. I agree to some extent, and hope that they use the same programming language.\nTests The most important thing I learnt during the preparation is to test the implementation. I realised the power of validation when taking the econometrics course (regression analysis and time series analysis) in Spring 2020, and . In particular, I reproduced all the examples in hendry2007econometric, so that my code for the final assignment have been validated. In a similar manner, I did all the exercises from the course again using Python (MATLAB in 2019), wrote tests using unittest Package. Last year, most of the validation is done through asking TAs, but I managed to find test cases from ross2017introductory and ross2012simulation this time. This approach has boosted my confidence in my results, and I have kept writing tests for all my repositories since then.\nAnother reason behind tests is that a large part of this simulation course is about validation. A real-world simulation program consists of multiple probability models that must be validated against data. There are two aspects, in my mind. First, the code must behave as expected and be robust enough. Mathematical simulation is code-intensive, but I found most of the students didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough experience with coding. The coding skill, I believe, is as important as writings, and others can hardly help if someone is unable to maintain about 1000 lines of code in a course like this.\nThe second step is to do statistical inference, which is even harder for those without such background knowledge. Last year, I had no idea as well, but tried my best to gain help from TAs. During the preparation, I realised that this was my first course that relies on scientific procedure, namely, hypotheses, experiment, and inference, even though with a background in thermal physics. My understanding was deepened when I answered questions, and it is discussed in the following two sections.\nKey Points and Hints Another key ability for this course besides the implementation, I think, is to read books. As far as I can remember, last year, my reading kept up with lectures. That is, I was able to go through corresponding sections in the textbook, which was not easy. Three-hours lectures were given everyday consecutively, so I had to read for many hours every night. Nevertheless, in my view, to have lots of patience with books can save the time.\nThis year, I found most students unable to grasp even the basic points. Most likely, they never read the recommended book, ross2012simulation. I do not think anyone can remember all the points mentioned by the teacher in the lecture. Even if there is a recording, it is hard to review the detail. In contrast, to highlight key points when reading is very easy and helps a lot in recap. I always remember the following advice of a physics teacher in my high school:\n A lecture is the time when you think critically about the points emphasised by someone else, not when you learn something new.\n Furthermore, it is impossible, I think, for someone to give step-by-step instructions for the implementation in terms of coding. There are many small-scale, specific issues that must be handled by the students in this course, and there are usually multiple ways to do a coding task. For example, to build a 2-D array for irregular sample space is a technique I thought of last year. Actually, to write code only takes a small portion of the project time, while how to write takes a lot of thinking. I tried my best to give hints, which had not been emphasised in the book, and most students were happy to take their time and think about my hints. To do something new by solving such manageable puzzles requires a deeper understanding of the task, which also gives students motivation for reading. On the other hand, the problem is not too open, and the students can always consult a well-written textbook or the teaching team.\nSuch idea played an important role, when I was designing a final project for the course, which is discussed in the following section.\n100% Solar Energy Project Each group had to choose one of the available projects as the final assignment. A real-world simulation project usually comes with context, and no available project was designed in the context of energy industry. I really like the \u0026ldquo;bottom-up\u0026rdquo; approach to simulate electricity consumption profiles [widén2010high]. The teacher agreed to let me design a new project based on that. One weekend is all the time I got to pull it off, but I decided to give it a try. My best friend in Denmark invited me for hot pot that weekend, because he was leaving Denmark for a PhD in Netherlands, but I have to say no. That is the first and probably the only project I design.\nIn the very beginning, I chose to publish the instruction on RPubs, which could be easily modified. In the mean time, to remind students of new contents, the \u0026ldquo;latest updates\u0026rdquo; section was put at the top of that webpage. I kept updating the whole webpage and received lots of valuable feedback.\nTo help them focus on the simulation part, I searched many websites, identified a reliable dataset, and transformed it into two compact CSV files. Actually, I am convinced that the transformation is the hardest part. After the deadline, I graded their reports, and was satisfied with their writing.\nReferences  Hendry, D.

Melosh）指出：“学术圈没有就（这些理论中的）任何一个达成共识”。\n《自然-地球科学》刊载的一项新研究可能会解决一些争议。新墨西哥大学的埃里克·卡诺（Erick Cano）和他的同事检查了阿波罗计划的月球表面样本，发现越深入表面以下，月球与地球的之间就有更多不同。这表明，月球和地球在成分上不像人们之前想的那样类似，这可能就排除了蒸汽岩石环模型，该模型假定后者和忒伊亚之间充分混合了它们的物质，然后分离出地球和月球。这些发现可能会把我们拉回到更经典的月球形成模型。“人们为此争论了60年，”该论文的审稿人之一，加州大学圣地亚哥分校的马克·蒂门斯（Mark Thiemens）评价道，“你能证明月球和外来撞击体有些相似，这非常了不起。”\n比较地球和月球组成的关键方法之一是测量样品中的氧同位素，即质量不同的氧原子。在太阳系不同位置形成的天体之间，各种同位素的含量是不同的。以前的研究发现，如果你对两处的样品分别取平均值，则月亮的各种氧同位素含量与地球的非常相似，这可能表明地球和忒伊亚之间进行了充分的混合，或者忒伊亚在太阳系中与地球相近的位置形成。如果忒伊亚在很远的地方形成，或者大碰撞后只有很少的混合，那么氧同位素应该有很大区别。\n但卡诺的团队没有对样本进行平均，而是研究了每个样本在月球取样时的位置，并发现了明显的差异，尽管靠近表面的各种氧同位素含量与地球的相似，但下层的却不同。“近似的含量对大碰撞假设来说的是个大难题，因为这些模型预测，月球应主要由来自外来撞击体的物质组成。”卡诺说，“我们发现含量确实存在区别，其取决于不同的岩石类型。\n他们的结果表明，撞击发生后，忒伊亚的残留被藏在月球的地幔深处。同时，在月球表面，汽化硅酸盐岩石组成的气层因大碰撞而形成，并慢慢冲刷着月球，导致其混合了来自地球的物质。“这逐渐沉降到了熔融态的月球上，但是，这并没有完全被混入月球岩浆海中，”卡诺说，“所以我们认为最深（区域）的样品受到的沾染最少。”\n梅洛什说，这一发现可能对月球形成的辩论产生重要的影响。“这一结果的主要影响是，它可能证伪蒸汽岩石环模型，或至少引起人们的怀疑。”他说。然而，加州大学戴维斯分校的莎拉·斯图尔特（Sarah Stewart）和她的同事西蒙·洛克（Simon Lock）于2018年提出的这个蒸汽岩石环模型，他们说这些发现还没有完全推翻它。关于月球形成的中心议题仍然存在，尤其是为什么和火星等其他地方比起来，地球的氧同位素含量和忒伊亚的更接近。“我们仍然被一个问题卡住，为什么形成月球的物体必须和地球类似，或者必须在大碰撞时发生时进行大量混合。”她说，“究竟发生了多少（混合）仍是个难题。”\n然而，新的结果表明，对于月球的成分，还有很多需要研究，而且科学家们就这个卫星的形成达成一致还需要一段时间。“很多人非常想知道它是如何形成的。”蒂门斯说。但是，如果在表面以下确实有忒伊亚存在的确凿证据，那可以帮助我们最终弄清楚这个外来撞击体的来源，以及它如何导致我们的太空邻居的诞生。\n

12 页开题报告，这一年多在丹麦的学习生活很不容易。每天入睡前都要思考两个问题，想法可不可行，有没有类似的想法。但只靠想是不够的，更需要阅读和写作，以及朋友的帮助。\n（本文由作者独立完成，原载于丹麦科技创业中心微信公众号，标题为我和丹麦的那些故事（五十七），时间是 2020 年 2 月 21 日，此转载未获许可，且禁止进一步转载。）\n  硕士毕设提案截图   从小想法到硕士提案，我认为靠的是坚定的信心、灵活的思维和多元化的团队。这里的思维灵活是指能够快速地从其他领域吸收有用的方法，不能局限于自己“一亩三分地”。在迷茫甚至是质疑声中坚定自己的信心是一大挑战，没有人会主动告诉你这个想法可行，这个想法的前景如何，下一步怎么办，这些都需要自己去决定。好消息是，在学术领域，没有绝对的错误或正确，更重要的是缜密的论证和讨论，如果最终证明了想法在某方面行不通，那也是一种贡献。\n丹麦人对无领导小组合作的学习工作方式走火入魔，这有利也有弊，我选择了尽量避开这种学习方式。我把硕士前期的主要任务定为提高编写计算机代码的能力，中期再开始扩大交际圈，提高语言能力。总体来说，我的丹麦学习生活非常与众不同，我想在以下三个方面简单地介绍一下，并给大家提几个小建议。\n阅读，写作 我认为阅读和写作是我这一年中用到的最重要的两项技能。英国以外欧洲国家的学生英语水平有限，所以老师尽量不强制学生阅读很多材料，很多课甚至都没有阅读材料，学生想要掌握内容只能靠老师讲和上课听。然而，很多老师的主要工作语言可能都不是英语，他们自己都很难把概念讲清楚。我花了大量的时间给每门课配了阅读材料，帮助我预习和复习课上的内容。读英文阅读材料虽然耗时费力，但是逻辑清晰且前后连贯，特别是学术书籍，很大的优势是符号和概念统一。\n  我所有的阅读材料，差不多读完了60%，很多已经被翻烂了   在这一年中，我的阅读能力得到了飞速的提高，从一开始反复阅读概论级别的学术书籍，提升到近几个月大范围的文献阅读。此外，我还发现很多我想不通的概念很早以前就有人讲清楚了，只是藏在图书馆的角落里面等待被发现，因为阅读不仅仅包括把眼前的文章读完，更需要的是发现有用的文章，对比类似的观点。我的毕设副导师是个哥本哈根商学院的一位经济学教授，这几次见面中，他给我最多的建议就是“keep reading”（持续地阅读）。\n我之前对英文写作的态度非常不端正，总是刻意回避写作任务，主要还是因为写作对思维输出的能力要求最高，但这也意味着写作是最重要的学习工具，只有当你把想法用自己的方式表达出来的时候，才意味着掌握了它。写作不仅仅局限于白纸黑字，还包括概念图、表格、计算机代码和数学表达，快速掌握同行们通用的表达方式是了解这个领域核心思想的重要方法。\n选课自由度 对我的学习影响最大的就是硕士项目的选课自由度。据我了解，总体上丹麦学校的专业的选课非常自由，必修课学分的占比很低，虽然这也引入了很多问题，但至少尊重了学生的意愿。在研究生阶段，我认为个人兴趣能够极大地调动自身积极性。提醒大家在择校和选专业的时候看准各种限制，花钱去学自己不喜欢的课太不值得了。\n我所在的可持续能源系是丹麦技术大学人数最多的一个系，这应该是选课限制较多的主要原因，这个问题让我十分困扰，甚至一度想转学。我坚持了下来，挤时间旁听了自己认为很关键的课程。另外，很多老师是不开课的，他们只会受邀请在其他老师的课上或者大型活动中作演讲，这些公共活动是了解老师的好机会，对以后的选课或者选毕设导师有很大帮助。\n  DTU 高科技峰会上 Pierre Pinson 教授的主题演讲   参加有组织的活动 这学期，一个偶然的机会让我发掘了一个小爱好，下国际象棋。学期开始的时候好朋友邀请我去，下意识是拒绝的，因为上次下国际象棋还是小学，但他保证帮我匹配实力相近的对手，最终我勉强答应。第一次去的前天夜里，我打开视频网站，搜索了国际象棋的讲解，死记硬背了几个开局套路，熟悉了一下相关的词汇，第二天硬着头皮就去了。结果同学们都非常友好，相互介绍了一番，初步了解一下对方的水平，就开始对弈。中途有说有笑，聊专业，吐槽天气，有疑惑了就相互解说一下自己的思考，气氛十分融洽。我那天赢了两盘，大家都互相称赞，约好下周再战。\n  DTU 国际象棋俱乐部头号选手同时对战三人，且为 3-10 分钟快棋，最终两胜，另一个未达成目标   万事开头难，任何人都很难接受自己不熟悉的事物；一旦入了门，也能很快就会融入到那个群体之中。我这一年多里从不同的领域吸收有用的技巧，应用到自己的想法中，也是相似的过程。经过一学期的训练，我收获的不仅仅是技艺的提高，还学会了对下棋进行系统性地描述和交流意见，更重要的是，认识了棋社的所有同学。除了棋社以外，我还听说有同学参加射箭俱乐部和羽毛球俱乐部。参加活动不仅能锻炼身体，更重要的是融入到当地的群体之中。\n总而言之，丹麦人很重视观点的多元性，但是结果往往是各执己见，无法达成共识，采取行动更无从谈起。这一年的学习生活让我坚信个人力量对于推动创新来说必不可少，同时，朋友的帮助能够锦上添花。丹麦人的学习生活方式和国内的有很大不同，希望大家能够分清优劣，走自己的道路。\n

国外硕士项目的主要内容还是上课，所以我认为课程要“全”而且“专”，才能满足研究生阶段的学习和研究需要。比如我的专业课程就包括了系统分析和系统优化的各个方面，又在能源规划、经济分析和可持续分析等方面有所侧重（如下图所示），我也可以设计自己的课程安排：\n    这样一来，不仅能学习各种各样的研究和分析方法，也能够在某个方法或者某个研究对象上有所突破，发展出自己独特的优势。\n对于硕士毕业后打算找工作的同学，可以通过专业的研究机构收集统计资料，以了解学校所在地和国家的产业现状，相关产业发达更利于本地就业。比如我从国际能源署（IEA）了解了丹麦以及其他国家的能源发展现状，知道了丹麦在分布式能源、生物质能、电力电子技术、风能等等领域都处于世界领先地位（如下图所示），所以就下决心来丹麦读能源类的硕士项目：\n    对于更具体的产业现状，就需要通过更多途径地了解。如果这个国家的相关产业非常繁荣，就非常有利于找工作，比如丹麦号称有 1000 家能源类企业，如下图所示，丹麦技术大学就在其中黑色圆圈的位置：\n    除了我了解的能源领域外，在很多领域，比如航运造船（A.P.穆勒集团）、相机（光学）、音响（声学）、多功能涂料、家居家具、皮草等等工业产业都很发达。所以丹麦学校相关的专业应该都不会很差，学生毕业之后也很好找工作。\n成熟的研究团队有能力开设系统的一系列课程，而不是离散的导论课，也能有更多的研究项目供同学选择。比如我的专业由丹麦技术大学管理学院的系统分析系开设，这个系原本隶属于丹麦里瑟国家能源实验室，这个最早由丹麦著名量子力学专家、诺贝尔奖得主玻尔创立的实验室于 2010 年被并入丹麦技术大学。这样的历史渊源就让我确信这个系的研究水平是很高的。\n再深入了解的话，系统分析系中的可持续量化分析团队（Quantitative Sustainability Assessment）排名世界第一（下图所示），系主任 Michael Zwicky Hauschild 教授 H 指数高达 63 ，这样的优秀团队就提供了继续读博的好机会：chen2014bibliometric\n    再比如说奥尔堡大学规划系的 Henrik Lund 教授是能源领域第一期刊 Energy 的主编，H 指数高达 57。他所在的规划系开设的城市、能源与环境规划专业就非常好，包括了下图显示的四个方向，是一个多学科交叉的新型专业。我相信这种资深教授领导的新型硕士项目的毕业生在就业市场一定能占得先机：\n    除了详细了解课程、产业现状和研究团队外，还有很多方面需要注意。比如丹麦技术大学和奥尔堡大学的能源类并不是按照大类招生的，因为没有对于专业的规定，所以只看专业名称的话基本不具有参考意义。再比如丹麦技术大学有两个风能专业，一个是独立的风能专业，偏向于风机的设计，另一个是可再生能源的一个研究方向，如下图所示，偏向于风电场运营：\n    此外，多了解学校项目的话也非常有利于确定自己以后想从事的工作。比如我刚开始报名的时候非常想研究生物质热化学转换，但是在看了奥尔堡大学新能源-过程工程和燃烧技术的课程之后就放弃了这个想法，因为对于我来说太困难了，所以我知道了我的基础不适合研究生物质热化学转换：\n    总而言之，我认为每个人的情况都是不同的，不能轻信某个人或者留学中介的建议，要选择最适合自己的项目，在这个过程中，我认为课程、产业现状和研究团队是最重要。希望我的经历能带给大家一点启发，对留学丹麦和择校有更好的理解。\n参考文献  Chen, H., Yang, Y., Yang, Y., Jiang, W., \u0026amp; Zhou, J.

It\u0026rsquo;s with this aim that I am applying for MSc in Sustainable Energy Program at Technical University of Denmark, focusing on Energy System Analysis.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s urgent and complex global environmental and energy issues invited me to the study of sustainable energy. To obtain insight into the current and future energy technology, I had several visits on different types of power plants and factories, like traditional power plant, new gas-fired combined cooling-heating-power plant, solar power plant with farming, etc. And I completed many internships and practices, concerning measurement, operation and maintenance. However, I found the challenges can\u0026rsquo;t be solved solely by discrete technologies. For example, subsidy fraud in the electric vehicle industry forced government to change the policy. Untrammeled construction of wind and solar energy caused ecological damage and curtailment.\nTherefore, I knew it was important to adopt a diverse portfolio of technologies, methods and ideas. I got in touch with knowledge from management, engineering economics, science communication, psychology, and so on. I took part in educational travels to Italy, Germany and Hong Kong. And I applied to be an exchange student in National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, and a visiting student in UW-Madison. Harmonies among environment, energy and economy deserve our attention. Bosco Verticale in Italy saved energy by utilizing plant transpiration for indoor refrigeration. Germany companies installed solar cells on rooftop instead of precious land by signing lease contracts. I found the solution for traffic jam and pollution, that MTR Subway Corporation in Hong Kong combined commerce and public transportation together to build an underground city. It set an example for de-carbonization and enriching community life in cities. Comparing the waste incineration in Chongqing and Taiwan, I figured out a fully-fledged waste sorting system rather than the state-of-art combustion technology was the key factor.\nFurthermore, this fast-changing field requires more than immersing in books and passing the exams. So, I learnt to do the design calculation and check calculation with Mathematica and MATLAB. I tried to model all the inter-related knowledge with semantic networks and info-graphs. I learnt to compile expert system, standard operating procedure and personal qualification standard, which proven to be essential in cooperative settings. This learning methodology, technology-enhanced learning by modeling, has helped me a lot.\nInnovation can always be made to tackle tough problems. For example, I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand why biogas failed in China in 1970s and made a comeback with the help of PCDM in Koyoto Protocol, until I finished the fieldwork in Chengdu to investigate Sichuan Rural Poor-Household Biogas Development PoA. Because accumulation of carbon emission reduction allowed profit from international carbon market. In addition, I signed up for experiment in Energy and Power Virtual Simulation Center, Chongqing University. Integrating knowledge from solar cell, wind turbine and micro-turbine, I managed to develop a distributed generation system based on hydrogen production and fuel cell with Simulink. This project needed not only basic principles of various technologies, but also automatic control and operational research for system integration.\nWhen being devoted to renewable energy research, I sought to develop myself through various extra-curricular activities as well. As the captain, I led color guard of marching brass band of Chongqing University to win the second prize in a national competition. Besides, I joined Learning Department, Student Union and Association of Energy Saving and Emission Reduction to help accelerate and communicate innovation. Thanks to these experiences, I have honed my leadership, communication, cooperation and crisis management abilities.\nIn regard for my future study and research, I\u0026rsquo;d like to focus on energy balance and GHG balance of various and sundry energy processes and systems, and learn to simulate and optimize. I have taken many courses for energy system analysis career and mastered some analysis skills. After studied exergy analysis, I applied pinch analysis to the design and optimization of distributed energy systems and industrial chemical processes to increase efficiency by limiting heat transfer exergy losses. Draw parameters from Hydrogen and Advanced Energy Power System and Fuel Cell, I compared hydrogen and electric vehicles through well-to-wheel analysis. However, to advance my knowledge in a more systematic way and perform more hand-on practice and research, I need further study and practice. For instance, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been fully conversant with multi-variable optimization, yet. Moreover, I plan to set thermo-chemical conversion of biomass as my main study and research subjects. Based on this, I can design, construct and evaluate distributed energy systems to provide clean, sustainable and affordable energy for people in under-developed areas. Motivated by the current condition that there are huge number of harming and polluting biomass stoves other than stable electricity and fuel in China and other developing countries, I\u0026rsquo;m willing to confront these challenges as soon as possible. And when I attended 2017 US-China Green Energy Summit, Daniel Kammen, the famous professor in energy analysis at University of California, Berkeley, supported my intention, and he said that scientific and technical transformations were critical to enabling a sustainable energy system, but it was social and policy innovation that provided the killer app for innovation and change. It is system development pattern that makes me eager to further my study and research in these fields.\nThis program is an ideal choice for me. DTU is research-based university, which occupies a prominent international position in research and education for sustainable development. What also makes DTU so attractive is its emphasis on creation, as well as its friendly and supportive atmosphere. And Denmark is especially known for distributed energy system and biomass utilization. I will do my best to pursue an amazing learning experience in your university.\n","date":"2017-11-26","permalink":"https://edxu96.github.io/post/ps/","tags":["application"],"title":"Personal Statement for MSc at DTU"}]
